                  <p class="lead ">William Butler Yeats was an Irish poet playwright and he was born in Sandymount, Ireland. He was 
                  regarded as an important figure in the Irish Cultural Revival. His early poems are characterised by romanticism in both their 
                  form and content. Moreover, his poems are often molded from Irish legends and the occult. He developed a lifelong 
                  interest in mysticism and spiritism. From 1900, his style of poetry gradully changed. His poetry became more physical 
                  and realistic and his later poems made a significant contribution to modernism.</p>

                  <h4>Love and marriage</h4>
                  <p>In 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, an English heiress and ardent Irish Nationalist. She greatly influenced Yeats's 
                  writings and his life. Many of Yeats's poems are inspired by her, or mention her, such as <i>This, This Rude 
                  Knocking</i>. He also wrote the play, <i>The Countess Cathleen</i> based on her prototype. Yeats loved her for many years. 
                  However, Gonne rejected his marriage proposal. In 1917, he married Georgie Hyde-Lees after his proposal was rejected by 
                  Iseult Gonne, the daughter of Maud Gonne.</p>
